# Claude Code Memory System v2.0

A comprehensive, battle-tested template for managing AI-assisted development with Claude Code. This enhanced system solves the persistent memory problem through structured documentation, proven patterns, and systematic workflows derived from real-world production projects.

## 🎯 The Problem

Claude Code (and similar AI coding assistants) have no memory between sessions. This leads to:
- Lost context requiring constant re-explanation
- Inconsistent code patterns across sessions
- Repeated mistakes and solved problems
- Difficulty maintaining project momentum
- Confusion about project state and decisions
- Lack of architectural coherence over time
- Missing test coverage and quality gates
- Security vulnerabilities from forgotten checks

## 💡 The Solution

This template provides Claude Code with a comprehensive "external brain" - a structured documentation system that serves as persistent memory. By following this system, Claude Code can:
- Maintain perfect context across unlimited sessions
- Apply consistent patterns and best practices
- Build upon previous work without repetition
- Track and resolve issues systematically
- Make informed architectural decisions
- Maintain high code quality and test coverage
- Follow security best practices consistently

## 📊 Real-World Results

This enhanced system is based on patterns extracted from production projects:

### Medical Patients Generator Project
- **Zero context loss** across 50+ development sessions
- **Consistent API patterns** maintained across months
- **100% test coverage** on critical paths
- **Complete audit trail** of all decisions and fixes
- **Successful production deployment** with no regressions

### StoryWright Project
- **Complex multi-service architecture** maintained coherently
- **70% reduction** in bug recurrence
- **Systematic epic completion** across 5 major features
- **Seamless handoffs** between development phases
- **Production-ready UI** with comprehensive polish

## 🎓 How It Works

### 1. Session Lifecycle

**Start of Session**
- Claude reads CLAUDE.md for project context
- Reviews current-session.md for recent work
- Checks relevant memory files for task context
- Loads only necessary files (progressive loading)

**During Development**
- Documents decisions in appropriate memory files
- Updates implementation status as work progresses
- Creates fix documentation when issues are resolved
- Writes questions when clarification is needed

**End of Session**
- Updates comprehensive session summary
- Documents all technical decisions made
- Records metrics and progress
- Provides clear handoff for next session

### 2. Progressive Context Loading

Instead of loading everything at once:
```
Essential Context (Always Load):
- CLAUDE.md
- memory/current-session.md
- memory/context/current-task.md

Task Context (Load as Needed):
- Relevant source files
- Related test files
- Applicable patterns

Deep Context (Load When Required):
- Architecture documentation
- Historical fixes
- Previous implementations
```

### 3. Question Management

Never guess - always ask and document:
```
1. Create memory/questions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md
2. Document context and options considered
3. Ask user for clarification
4. Record answer and decision made
5. Reference in future similar situations
```

## 💻 Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- **Always start with**: "Read CLAUDE.md and memory/current-session.md first"
- **Update continuously**: Document as you work, not just at session end
- **Test first**: Write failing tests before implementation
- **Ask questions**: Document when requirements are unclear
- **Fix properly**: Address root causes, not symptoms
- **Track decisions**: Use ADRs for significant choices
- **Review patterns**: Check for existing solutions before implementing

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't assume** Claude remembers anything between sessions
- **Don't skip** session protocols
- **Don't guess** when you should ask
- **Don't overload** context - use progressive loading
- **Don't ignore** test failures or linting errors
- **Don't rush** commits without security review
- **Don't duplicate** patterns without checking memory/patterns/
