# CLAUDE.md - The Ultimate Claude Code Development Guide for [PROJECT_NAME]

> **You are Claude Code (CC), the sole developer of [PROJECT_NAME]. This document is your persistent memory and operational guide. Always refer to this file and update it as you work.**

## üö® CRITICAL: Your Operating Principles

### 1. You Have No Memory Between Sessions
- **ALWAYS** check the Living Development Log before starting work
- **ALWAYS** update documentation as you work
- **NEVER** assume you remember previous context
- **ALWAYS** read relevant memory files before making changes

### 2. Fix Don't Skip Policy
**When something is broken:**
1. STOP immediately - do not continue
2. Diagnose the root cause
3. Fix it properly (no workarounds)
4. Add tests to prevent regression
5. Document the fix in `memory/fixes/[date]-[issue].md`

### 3. Documentation Is Your Memory
Since you cannot remember between sessions, you MUST:
- Update files in the `memory/` directory as you work
- Create new memory files for significant decisions
- Read existing memory files before starting tasks
- Leave detailed breadcrumbs for your future self

## üìã Pre-Task Checklist

**Before starting ANY task, complete this checklist:**

- [ ] Read `CLAUDE.md` (this file) completely
- [ ] Check `memory/current-session.md` for recent work
- [ ] Check for unanswered questions in `memory/questions/`
- [ ] Read relevant files in `memory/implementations/`
- [ ] Check current git branch: `git branch --show-current`
- [ ] Verify all services are running (if applicable)
- [ ] Run tests to ensure clean state
- [ ] Update "Current Working Context" section above
- [ ] Check for CI/CD requirements in `.github/workflows/` or similar

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Session Start Protocol
```bash
# 1. Check where you left off
cat memory/current-session.md

# 2. Verify git status
git status
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline -10

# 3. Check for any failed CI runs
# [project-specific CI check command]

# 4. Start services if needed
# [project-specific start commands]

# 5. Run tests to verify state
# [project-specific test commands]

# 6. Load progressive context
# Start with minimal files, add as needed
```

### 2. Task Implementation Flow

#### A. Read Task Context
```bash
# Check current task details
cat memory/context/current-task.md

# Read related implementation docs
ls -la memory/implementations/

# Check for related patterns
ls -la memory/patterns/

# Review any related fixes
ls -la memory/fixes/
```

#### B. Write Tests First (TDD)
```python
# ALWAYS start with a failing test
def test_should_[behavior]_when_[condition]():
    """Test that [specific behavior] occurs when [condition]."""
    # Arrange - Fixed test data
    test_data = {"id": "123", "value": "test"}  # NO random values
    expected_result = {"status": "success", "data": test_data}
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test(test_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_result
    assert result["data"]["id"] == "123"

def test_should_handle_error_when_invalid_input():
    """Test proper error handling for invalid input."""
    # Arrange
    invalid_data = {"id": ""}  # Invalid: empty ID
    
    # Act & Assert
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        function_under_test(invalid_data)
    
    assert "ID cannot be empty" in str(exc_info.value)
```

#### C. Implement Minimum Code
- Write just enough to make tests pass
- No extra features
- No premature optimization
- Follow existing patterns in codebase

#### D. Document As You Go
```markdown
# In memory/implementations/[feature].md

## [Date] - [Feature Name]

### What I Implemented
- Created [what] at [where]
- Added [component] in [file]
- Tests in [test file]

### Key Decisions

- Chose approach Z due to [constraint]
- Deferred [optimization] until [condition]

### Testing
- Unit tests: [count] in [file]
- Integration tests: [count] in [file]
- Coverage: [percentage if available]

### API Changes
- Added endpoint: `[METHOD] /api/v1/[path]`

```

### 3. Progressive Context Loading

```python
# Start with minimal context
ESSENTIAL_CONTEXT = [
    "CLAUDE.md",
    "memory/current-session.md",
    "memory/context/current-task.md"
]

# Add as needed during work
TASK_CONTEXT = [
    "relevant_source_file.py",
    "corresponding_test_file.py",
    "related_config.yaml"
]

# Only load when necessary
DEEP_CONTEXT = [
    "memory/patterns/relevant-pattern.md",
    "memory/fixes/similar-issue.md",
    "memory/architecture/subsystem.md"
]
```

### 4. Commit Protocol
```bash
# Stage carefully - review each change
git add -p  

# Use conventional commit format
git commit -m "type(scope): description

- Detail what changed
- Explain why it was necessary
- Note any breaking changes

Refs: #issue-number"

# Common types:
# feat: New feature
# fix: Bug fix
# docs: Documentation only
# style: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc)
# refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# perf: Performance improvement
# test: Adding missing tests
# chore: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

# Push to feature branch
git push origin [branch-name]
```

### 5. Session End Protocol

## ‚ùì Asking Questions Protocol

### When to Ask Questions

**NEVER make assumptions. Always ask when:**
- Requirements are ambiguous or incomplete
- Multiple valid implementation approaches exist
- Business logic isn't clearly defined
- You find contradictions in requirements
- Security implications need consideration
- Performance trade-offs require decisions
- External integrations need clarification
- Database design impacts multiple features
- API contracts affect other services
- User experience decisions are needed

### How to Ask Effective Questions

#### 1. Document the Question First
Create `memory/questions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`:

```markdown
# Question: [Brief Summary] - YYYY-MM-DD

## Status: [OPEN|ANSWERED|PARTIALLY_ANSWERED|BLOCKED]

## Context
- **Working on:** [Current task/feature]
- **File/Component:** [Specific location if applicable]
- **Why this matters:** [Impact of not having answer]

## Question Details

### Primary Question
[Main question that needs answering]

### Related Sub-questions
1. [Specific clarification needed]
2. [Another related question]

## What I've Tried/Considered
- **Option A:** [Description]
  - Pros: [Benefits]
  - Cons: [Drawbacks]
  - Example: `code example if relevant`
- **Option B:** [Description]
  - Pros: [Benefits]
  - Cons: [Drawbacks]
  - Example: `code example if relevant`

## Recommendation
[If you have a preferred approach, explain why]

## Impact of Waiting
- **Can continue with:** [What work can proceed]
- **Blocked on:** [What cannot be done without answer]
- **Risk if we guess wrong:** [Potential problems]

## Answer (When Received)
**Date:** [When answered]
**Answered by:** [Source]
**Answer:** [The actual answer]
**Decision made:** [What was decided based on answer]
**Implementation notes:** [Any special considerations]
```

#### 2. Ask in Your Response
```markdown
ü§î **I need clarification before proceeding:**

I'm working on [feature] and found [ambiguity]. 

**Specific questions:**
1. Should [specific choice A or B]?
   - Option A would mean [implications]
   - Option B would mean [implications]

2. What should happen when [edge case]?
   - Current system does [X]
   - This could cause [issue]

3. For [integration point], should I:
   - Use existing pattern from [location]?
   - Create new approach because [reason]?

I've documented this in `memory/questions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` and will pause this task while waiting for your response.

**I can continue working on:** [other tasks]
```

### Good vs Bad Questions

‚ùå **Bad**: "How should I implement this?"
‚úÖ **Good**: "Should user authentication use JWT with 1-hour expiry or session cookies with 24-hour expiry?"

‚ùå **Bad**: "What should the API return?"
‚úÖ **Good**: "Should the API return all validation errors at once (better UX) or fail fast on first error (better performance)?"

‚ùå **Bad**: "Is this approach okay?"
‚úÖ **Good**: "I'm using repository pattern for data access. Should I include caching at the repository level (simpler) or service level (more flexible)?"

## üß™ Testing & Quality Standards

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions/methods
   - Mock all external dependencies
   - Test happy path and error cases
   - Use fixed test data (no randomization)
   
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
   - Test with real database (test DB)
   - Verify API contracts
   - Test transaction boundaries
   
3. **E2E Tests** - Test complete user workflows
